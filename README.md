What we aim to do is:
1. Create a script that builds a vm 
2. Build a vm using the script 
3. Create a script that installs an outdated or not current version of Ubuntu ðŸ¤“
4. Run the ubuntu install script in the vm ðŸ‘¨ðŸ’»ðŸ‘©ðŸ’»ðŸ§‘ðŸ’»
5. Once the older version of Ubuntu is running in the VM, upgrade it to the newest/current version of Ubuntu (which is 24.10)ðŸŽ‰ðŸ’»
Note - By default, when you use Multipass you get the most recent version.
